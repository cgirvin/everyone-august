### Great Places to Eat

- The Royal Cafe is one of my favorite breakfast places. Definitely try the fresh-baked scones with homemade lemon curd!
- There is a burrito place, I think it's called Best Burrito, that's run by a Mexican man and his Japanese wife. Try the teriyaki burrito, with chicken or mushrooms-- it'll change your life.
- Mangia Mangia is my family's favorite Italian restaurant. I've yet to have anything there that I didn't like!
