I don't really have a hometown, but below are the two places I lived longest before I could vote.

## Cortland, New York

### Local Highlights
#### Restaurants
 - Doug's Fish Fry
 - That one Chinese buffet that got shut down by the health department (great onions rings)
 - Friendly's?
#### Else
 - 1890s House is a lovely mansion/museum
 - I don't know why this won't format correctly

### Adjacent Places
 - West is the Fingers Lakes region, with countless wineries and lake-related activities and hiking
 - North is Syracuse, with highlights such as the large mall and the zoo, and of course Dinosaur BBQ
 - South is Binghamton!  Not too exciting, but my grandparents live near there in Greene, and that town is appallingly quaint
 - East doesn't make sense to go, but eventually you get to the Catskills, and they're very pretty

## Iowa City, Iowa
